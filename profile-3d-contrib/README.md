# 3D Contribution Graph

This directory contains the 3D contribution graph generated by GitHub Actions.
The graph is automatically updated daily via the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/profile-3d.yml`.

If the graph hasn't been generated yet, you can:
1. Wait for the scheduled run (daily at midnight UTC)
2. Manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab
3. Push a commit to the main branch to trigger generation
